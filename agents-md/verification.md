## Verification

Use this verification flow while developing:

* Lint after every small change: `pnpm lint` (or `pnpm lint:fix` to auto-fix).

* Run focused/unit tests as you go: `pnpm --filter @mp-lb/zapper test <path-to-test-file>`.

* Run the normal test suite before wrapping up: `pnpm test`.

* Run end-to-end tests once near the end of a big change, when you think the work is done:

  * `pnpm test:e2e` runs tests inside an isolated Linux VM via `packages/cli/etc/e2e_run.sh` (macOS + Lima).

  * One-time setup for that VM flow: `bash ./packages/cli/etc/e2e_setup.sh`.

  * Then run: `pnpm test:e2e`.

### Agent responsibility

Always build with `pnpm build` after making changes if you're on the main branch in the base repo. Make it clear in your final response that its all built.
