## Delivery

Push `main` to deploy the services selected in `.arcnet/arcnet.yaml`; check the ArcNet workflow to confirm deployment.

Packages are selected by their `package.json`: use `private: true` for internal packages and `private: false` with `publishConfig.access: public` for packages intended for npm. The publisher scans immediate children of `packages/` and `apps/`; a missing `private` field also makes a package eligible. GitHub Packages uses its own registry configuration.

The npm workflow on pushes to `main` compares packed package contents with npm and publishes changed packages at the next patch version. ArcNet supplies the configured publishing credential through its `publish` secret consumer; the secret source must contain `NPM_TOKEN`. Check the workflow run to confirm publication. First publication may require an authenticated local publish, depending on npm credentials and trusted-publisher setup.
