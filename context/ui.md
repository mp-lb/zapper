## Frontend

Use shadcn/ui consistently for supported UI patterns. Reuse installed components before creating anything new; when a suitable component is missing, install it through the CLI rather than hand-building a substitute. Use the existing `cn` utility for conditional classes.

Run these commands from the frontend package containing `components.json`:

```sh
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest list @shadcn
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest search @shadcn -q dialog
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add dialog
```

`components.json` defines component aliases and the theme CSS location; resolve its `aliases.ui` through the app's TypeScript aliases to find installed components. Review existing files before installation and preserve local customizations; do not blindly use `--overwrite`.

Use the shared theme tokens and existing component variants for colors, typography, spacing and radii. UI consistency takes priority over making one screen look different. Do not override theme-owned styles in individual components without a concrete reason; make intentional design-system changes at the shared theme or component level.

MAP Lab's Shad repository (`~/Work/shad`) provides additional components at `https://shad.mp-lb.dev`. Consult its catalog before building an equivalent, for example:

```sh
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://shad.mp-lb.dev/r/ui-states.json
```

Frontend packages: `apps/landing-page`. Run component installation in the relevant package.
