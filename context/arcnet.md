## ArcNet

This project uses ArcNet. `.arcnet/arcnet.yaml` records its configured sources, consumers and selected deployment services. Read that configuration and the delivery block before changing infrastructure. Minimal installations may only manage secrets/variables; do not assume an application is deployed.

Keep deployment build paths, runtime entrypoints, health settings and domains aligned with the actual applications. Local databases are not automatically deployment services. Verify the relevant workflow and runtime result after delivery.

Setup and updates: `fm read extensions/arcnet/README.md --store mp-lb/fssstack` and `fm read SETUP.md --store mp-lb/arcnet`.
